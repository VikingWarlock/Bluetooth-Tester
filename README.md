# Bluetooth Tester

If you have many bluetooth-based devices to test, it is so tiring to build application for each of them.

What if we can use only one application to test every bluetooth devices?

When a new bluetooth device comes out, we just edit or create a configure file to let the test application to adapt it.

This is super easy for testing.

In order to make this work, I have to design the configure file first. Base on an example configure file, I will know how to resolve the configure file and let the test application work.

### Progress

1.Design Example Test Configure File (test-case-example.json). [30%]

2.Design the configure file protocol (bluetooth-test-case-design-protocol.md). [10%]

3.Design BLUETOOTH part of the test application. []

4.Design TEST Part of the test application. []

5.Make the application out. [5%]
